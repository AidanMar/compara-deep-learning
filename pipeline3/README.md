# Gene Pair Orthology Prediction Using Deep Learning

## Project Goal

The aim of this project is to take pairs of genes from different species and predict the nature of their evolutionary relationship. Primarily, this concerns whether the genes are orthologs or paralogs (see: [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_homology#Orthology)).
