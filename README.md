Using Deep Learning techniques to enhance orthology calls

This project aims to apply machine learning algorithms like Deep Learning Neural Networks to validate the homologies predicted with our method in addition to infer new ones based on other properties of the data that are currently not being considered (such as local synteny, divergence rates, etc).
